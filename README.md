Hi! I am Guillermo Jorge from United States but im living actually on Dominican Republic. 
Im trying to learn, pratice and discover all about tecnology because thats my passion.
I like programming, Learn something new and play or made videogames.
Im currently on a university but I try to learn in and out of there.
If wanna know about my progress, I got a twitter with the #100daysOfCode on my bio (check it out ;D).
